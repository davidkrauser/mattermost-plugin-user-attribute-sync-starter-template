# User Attribute Sync Starter Template

A Mattermost plugin starter template that demonstrates how to synchronize user profile attributes from external systems into Mattermost's Custom Profile Attributes (CPA). This template serves as both a working reference implementation and an educational resource for plugin developers.

## What This Template Demonstrates

Mattermost's Custom Profile Attributes system (also called Properties) allows you to store structured metadata about users. A **field** defines the schema (name, type, options), while a **value** stores the actual data for a specific user. For multiselect fields, **options** define the allowed choices that users can select from.

This plugin demonstrates how to create fields with hardcoded definitions and synchronize values from external data sources. Fields are defined explicitly in code with their types (text, date, multiselect), and the plugin uses Mattermost's cluster job system to run periodic synchronization tasks. The implementation includes incremental synchronization that processes only changed data after the initial sync.

The template creates three example fields: Job Title (text), Programs (multiselect with options Apples, Oranges, and Lemons), and Start Date (date in YYYY-MM-DD format). All fields are marked as hidden (not shown in profile/user card) and admin-managed (users cannot edit).

## Architecture Overview

```
Plugin Activation (Once)
  ├─> Create/Update CPA Fields
  └─> Start Background Job

Background Job (On timed interval)
  ├─> Fetch Changed Values From External Source
  └─> Bulk Upsert Values
```

### Key Components

- **Field Definitions** (`server/sync/field_sync.go`) - Hardcoded schema with field types and options
- **Value Sync** (`server/sync/value_sync.go`) - User attribute value synchronization
- **File Provider** (`server/sync/file_provider.go`) - Example JSON file-based data source
- **Job Orchestrator** (`server/job.go`) - Cluster-aware periodic sync scheduler

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- Mattermost server 11.1.0 or later
- Go 1.21 or later
- Node v16 and npm v8 (if modifying webapp)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-user-attribute-sync-starter-template
   cd mattermost-plugin-user-attribute-sync-starter-template
   ```

2. Build the plugin:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

3. **Important**: Copy the example data file to your Mattermost data directory:
   ```bash
   cp data/user_attributes.json /path/to/mattermost/data/user_attributes.json
   ```

   The plugin reads from `data/user_attributes.json` relative to the Mattermost data directory (not the plugin directory). Update the JSON file with your users' email addresses and attributes. See `data/user_attributes.json` in this repository for the expected format.

4. Upload the plugin through System Console → Plugin Management, or use:
   ```bash
   make deploy
   ```

## What to Expect

When the plugin activates, it creates the three Custom Profile Attribute fields (Job Title, Programs, and Start Date) in Mattermost. These fields appear in System Console → User Attributes. If the fields already exist from a previous activation, the plugin updates them to match the hardcoded definitions.

Immediately after activation, the plugin runs its first synchronization. It reads the `user_attributes.json` file from the Mattermost data directory, matches users by email address, and populates the Custom Profile Attribute values for each user found in the data file. The plugin logs its progress and any errors (such as users not found in Mattermost) during this process.

After the initial sync, the plugin checks for changes every 60 minutes by default. The file provider tracks the modification time of `user_attributes.json` and only processes the file if it has been modified since the last sync. When changes are detected, the plugin syncs all users in the file again. You can adjust the sync interval in the plugin configuration settings.

The synced attribute values are stored as Custom Profile Attributes and can be viewed through the Mattermost API or by querying the database directly. Since the fields are marked as hidden, they do not appear in user profiles or user cards in the UI.

## Customization Guide

### Adding New Fields

Edit `server/sync/field_sync.go` and add entries to the `fieldDefinitions` array:

```go
{
    Name:         "Department",
    ExternalName: "department",
    Type:         model.PropertyFieldTypeText,
},
```

Restart the plugin to create the new field.

### Changing Multiselect Options

Update the `OptionNames` array in `fieldDefinitions`:

```go
{
    Name:         "Programs",
    ExternalName: "programs",
    Type:         model.PropertyFieldTypeMultiselect,
    OptionNames:  []string{"Apples", "Oranges", "Lemons", "Bananas"},
},
```

Restart the plugin to add new options. This template plugin never removes existing options from Mattermost because users may have already selected those values.

### Changing Sync Interval

The sync interval can be configured in the plugin settings. Navigate to System Console → Plugins → User Attribute Sync Starter Template and adjust the "Sync Interval (Minutes)" setting. The default is 60 minutes.

### Changing Data File Path

Edit `server/sync/file_provider.go` and modify the constant:

```go
const defaultDataFilePath = "data/my_custom_file.json"
```

### Implementing Custom Data Sources

The template uses a file-based provider, but you can swap this for any data source:

1. **Implement the `AttributeProvider` interface** in a new file (e.g., `server/sync/api_provider.go`):
   - `GetUserAttributes()` - Fetch user data from your external system
   - `Close()` - Clean up resources

2. **Update `server/job.go`** to use your provider:
   ```go
   provider := sync.NewAPIProvider(apiURL, apiKey)
   ```

3. **Handle incremental sync** by tracking state internally (e.g., last sync timestamp)

Common provider implementations:
- **REST API**: Poll external API for changed users since last sync
- **LDAP**: Query directory for users modified after last sync time
- **Database**: Query users table with `updated_at > last_sync`
- **Webhook**: Accept push notifications of changed users (requires API endpoint)

### Field Type Constraints

**Important**: Field types cannot be changed after creation (Mattermost platform limitation). To change a field type:
1. Delete the field (all user values will be lost). You can do this via the Mattermost API or by adding code to delete the field during plugin activation.
2. Update the field definition in code
3. Restart the plugin to recreate with new type
